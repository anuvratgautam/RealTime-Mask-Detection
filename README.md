# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

A deep learning–based real-time face mask detector that uses a webcam feed to classify whether a person is **wearing a mask** or **not wearing a mask**. The project is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **OpenCV**, making it fast, lightweight, and easy to run on laptops (including M-series MacBooks).

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-Time Detection** – Runs live on your webcam feed.
* **High Accuracy** – Trained on a large, clean dataset from Kaggle.
* **Lightweight Model** – Efficient CNN architecture that performs well without a dedicated GPU.
